# Creating Reproducible Data Science Workflows using Docker Containers

## Audience Level

Intermediate

## Brief Description

Jupyter notebooks make it easy to create reproducible workflows that can be distributed across groups and organizations. This is a simple process provided our end-users have access to the data along with a compatible Python environment. Learn how to use Docker to package a shareable image containing the libraries, code, and data required to reproduce every calculation.

## Detailed Abstract

Containerization technologies such as Docker enable software to run across various computing environments. Data Science requires auditable workflows where we can easily share and reproduce results. Docker is a useful tool that we can use to package libraries, code, and data into a single image.

This talk will cover the basics of Docker; discuss how containers fit into Data Science workflows; and provide a quick-start guide that can be used as a template to create a shareable Docker image!

Learn how to leverage the power of Docker without having to worry about the underlying details of the technology. Although this session is geared towards data scientists, the underlying concepts have many use cases (come find me after to discuss).

## Additional Notes

[Github of my talks](https://github.com/alysivji/talks). Alright, you got me. Just talk. Only 1 so far, but this is changing! I jumped into Python last December and I continue to give it everything I have. I love the community. It has changed my life and empowered me as a developer. Now, I want to give back to the community and help those who were where I used to be.

I was invited to speak at the Chicago Value-based Healthcare Technology meetup on how the Hadoop ecosystem can be used to drive innovation in healthcare analytics. I also co-led an open session at PyCon 2017 related to Jupyter notebook tricks and tips. As an active participant in the community, I am only looking forward to what the future is going to bring for our industry and am excited to be a part of it.
