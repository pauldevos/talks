## Description

The Chicago Python Users Group (ChiPy) is one of the world's largest Python meetups featuring weekly events for our 4300+ members. The ChiPy community leverages Slack as our primary communication platform in-between events. Our Slack workspace has many application integrations, but nothing in the App Marketplace focused on our specific needs. A team was formed to develop an open-source Slack bot, codename: Busy Beaver, to increase ChiPy member engagement.

Since Busy Beaver's release in mid-January, the team has added new contributors and features while revamping the entire backend architecture. This talk will introduce Busy Beaver; discuss the challenges of building a project in public; dig into architecture and code; and examine the future roadmap of the project.
