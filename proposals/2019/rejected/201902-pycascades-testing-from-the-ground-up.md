# Testing from the Ground Up

## Length

30

## Audience

Beginner

## Elevator Pitch

Tests ensure our program works as intended and that changes to the codebase do not break existing functionality. However, these benefits aren’t free; we need to have a plan to write our app and to test it. This talk will introduce concepts and techniques that can be used to write effective tests.

## Longer Description

Seasoned developers can balance writing code to solve business problems with writing tests to ensure correctness and prevent regression. Finding this balance and knowing what to test can feel more like an art than a science, especially to those new to the industry. This talk will introduce testing concepts and explore the following topics:

* Benefits of testing
* Blackbox vs whitebox testing
* Automated vs manual testing
* Types of tests
* Test metrics
* Tools that simplify the testing process

This session is geared towards developers who want to write tests but are not sure where to start. After this talk, test newbies will have all the skills and knowledge to write their first test. Attendees with testing experience will be exposed to tools and techniques that can make them more effective testers.

## Notes

At my last job, I was responsible for building out an integrated testing framework for a microservices-based backend architecture. This project required me to dig into testing tools and techniques which increased my team's testing efficiency and enabled us to ship code faster. Since then I have been organizing my thoughts into a [blog series](https://alysivji.github.io/drafts/testing-101-introduction-to-testing.html) and talk in order to create the resource I that would have wanted when I first got started testing.

I previously presented this talk at a couple of local Python meetups (IndyPy, Chicago Python). Beginners appreciated how I did not make assumptions about previous knowledge and folks with testing experience told me they learned new tools and techniques they could add to their arsenal.
