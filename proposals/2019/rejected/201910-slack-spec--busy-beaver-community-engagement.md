# Busy Beaver: Chicago Python's Community Engagement Slack bot

## Brief talk description (fewer than 150 words)

The Chicago Python Users Group (ChiPy) is
one of the largest tech-focused communities in the United States.
We use Slack to continue conversations and
develop relationships in-between our group’s weekly events.

ChiPy developed an open-source community engagement Slack bot,
codename: Busy Beaver, that integrates with
various third-party APIs to better serve members of our hyperlocal, niche workspace.
Users can find information about upcoming events; view feeds
from our social media channels; and gain insights into other members’ side projects.
An open-source community has developed around Busy Beaver with
developers from around the world making contributions to our custom application.

## Why will this talk be uniquely interesting to Slack developers? What's the main takeaway

This session will discuss how understanding your users will allow you to
develop custom applications to keep folks active and engaged.

Understanding your users is the first step in creating a great application.
This is true for custom applications as it is true for third-party integrations.
Your goal as a Slack developer is to improve the experience for workspace users.
We will describe Chicago Python’s experience in
building an open-source Slack integration for our community by our community.
