## Description

Open Source Software (OSS) has changed the world in countless ways and has provided us with wonderful innovations such as the Python programming language. As Pythonistas, we use OSS every single day but only a fraction of us give back to the community.

This talk will discuss the benefits of contributing to open source in the context of my experience as a newbie pandas contributor. I will also provide a Getting Started guide so you, too, can become an Open Source Contributor!
