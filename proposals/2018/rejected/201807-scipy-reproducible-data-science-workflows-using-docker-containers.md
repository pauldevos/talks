# Reproducible Data Science Workflows using Docker Containers

## Abstract

Containerization technologies such as Docker enable software to run across various computing environments. Data Science requires auditable workflows where we can easily share and reproduce results. Docker is a useful tool that we can use to package libraries, code, and data into a single image. This talk will cover the basics of Docker; discuss how containers fit into various Data Science workflows; and provide a quick-start guide that can be used as a template to create a shareable Docker image! Learn how to leverage the power of Docker without having to worry about the underlying details of the technology.

## Short Summary

Jupyter notebooks make it easy to create reproducible workflows that can be distributed across groups and organizations. This is a simple process provided our end-users have access to the data along with a compatible Python environment. Learn how to use Docker to package a shareable image containing the libraries, code, and data required to reproduce every calculation.
