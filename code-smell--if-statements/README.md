# `if` Statements are a Code Smell

## Talk Description

`if` statements allow us to selectively execute code based on conditional logic. Overusing conditionals produces code that is hard to read and difficult to modify. This talk will demonstrate how to refactor `if` statements into polymorphic classes, resulting in cleaner program design. After this session, you will be able to implement complex conditional logic using simple Python classes.
